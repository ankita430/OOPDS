### Title 
Write a simple C program to print "Hello world" on screen and understand the complete development process.

### Theory
Compiling program is the process of converting high level programming language into low level programming language that can be executed by computer's central processing unit. To turn a C program into an executable file, a series of steps that involve writing, compiling, and linking the code.

### Title
Write a C program to print size of different data types.

### Theory
The sizeof operator in C is used to determine the size, in bytes, of a data type or a variable. The syntax for using the sizeof operator is as follows: sizeof (type); 
The %lu or %zu format specifier used for sizeof operator.

### Title
Write a C program to read a number from user and print a table of multiplication for that number.

### Aim
To print a table of a number.

### Explanation
By using for loop, table of multiplication for any number will be execute.

### Title
Write a program to display different star patterns on screen.

### Aim 
To print star pattern.

### Explanation
In this programme, the user wants to make a pattern by entering the number of rows and columns. The programme creates a pattern of stars with two halves: one with ascending rows and the other with descending rows, separated by a newline character. The number of stars in each row is determined by the value of "i" within the respective loops by using nested for loops.

### Output Screenshot
![star pattern](https://github.com/ankita430/OOPDS-Lab-Assignment/assets/141404641/e5e872dc-a1b7-4679-a0e0-04dcedd462cc)

### Title
Write a program to demonstrate pointers. Declare a pointer ptr to interger and equate it to address of integer i. Print value of i, value of &i, value of ptr and value of *ptr.

### Theory
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. It "points" to the location in memory where data is stored. int *ptr; declares a pointer ptr that can point to an integer.

### Explanation
This program explain how pointers can be used to access memory addresses and the values stored at those addresses. 

### Output Screenshot

### Title
Write a program in C to demonstrate function call by value and call by reference by writing a swap function to swap two integers.

### Theory
In C programming there are two ways to pass an arguments to functions : call by value and call by reference, These two methods determine how the function receives and operates on its parameters. In call by value, copies of the actual values are made and passed to the function. And In call by reference, arguments pass the memory address of the actual variables to the function.

### Explanation
In this program swap1, which is used to swap the values of two integers using pointers, call by reference. 

### Output Screenshot

### Title
 Write a program to declare a char array of 20 characters. Read a word (using scanf or cin >> ) into the char array.

### Theory
In programming, a character array is a data structure used to store sequences of characters, such as strings, in a contiguous block of memory. It is a fundamental part of many programming languages and plays a crucial role in text processing, manipulation, and storage. To declare a character array, you specify its data type, the array name, and its size. 

### Explanation
The given C++ program demonstrates how to declare a character array, read user input into the array, and then display the input back to the user. A character array named word is declared. It has a size of 20 characters, meaning it can store up to 19 characters plus a null-terminator (a special character, '\0', used to mark the end of strings).

### Output Screenshot
![declare a char array](https://github.com/ankita430/OOPDS-Lab-Assignment/assets/141404641/7d6055fc-965a-4641-a9d3-18455cbf56fb)
