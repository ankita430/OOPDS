### Theory
Compiling program is the process of converting high level programming language into low level programming language that can be executed by computer's central processing unit. To turn a C program into an executable file, a series of steps that involve writing, compiling, and linking the code.

### Title
Write a program to display different star patterns on screen.

### Aim 
To print star pattern.

### Explanation
In this programme, the user wants to make a pattern by entering the number of rows and columns. The programme creates a pattern of stars with two halves: one with ascending rows and the other with descending rows, separated by a newline character. The number of stars in each row is determined by the value of "i" within the respective loops by using nested for loops.

### Output Screenshot
